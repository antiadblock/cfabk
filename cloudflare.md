Ads are important part of the web ecosystem where many web sites pay their bills by displaying ads to the visitors, with the increase in ad-blocking plugins such as AdBlock, publishers are losing revenue and websites are no longer self-sustaining.

#How it Works
Once a page is loaded. Anti Adblock tries to load a dummy advertisement (which does not contain any ads).
If the script is loaded then ads are not being blocked in that page. otherwise the application will detect that some 
adblocking software or extenstion such as Adblock Plus is being used by the visitor.Then a meaasge will be displayed 
to the user requesting him to turn off adblocker for your site.
